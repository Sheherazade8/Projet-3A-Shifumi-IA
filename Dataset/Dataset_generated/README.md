# CGI-Generated Images Dataset Description

## Overview
This dataset contains approximately 2900 images generated using CGI (Computer Generated Imagery) on a white background. The advantage is the variety of hands (races, ages, genders, nail polish). However, some hands may sometimes appear distorted.

## Access
The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/frtgnn/rock-paper-scissor).

## Usage
This dataset provides CGI-generated images suitable for training, testing, and evaluating gesture recognition models. It offers diverse hand variations, including different races, ages, genders, and nail polish, on a consistent white background.

## Limitations
- Some hands may appear distorted due to CGI rendering.
- Limited variations in terms of background.
