# Dataset_real Description

## Overview
Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) Real Images is a freely available dataset on Kaggle, comprising over 2100 images of hands performing the three gestures of rock-paper-scissors (approximately 700 per class). The hands vary in size and age of individuals, and some have sleeves while others do not. However, there are no jewelry, nail polish, or tattoos, and all individuals have white skin. The images are taken on a green background, always in the same orientation. Although this dataset is relevant for classification, we cannot solely base our system on these images as it may introduce bias. Moreover, the constraint of the green background is a limitation we would like to overcome.

## Access
The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/drgfreeman/rockpaperscissors).

## Usage
This dataset can be used for training, testing, and evaluating gesture recognition models. It provides a diverse set of real-world images representing the rock-paper-scissors gestures.

## Limitations
- Potential bias due to uniform skin color and background.
- Limited variation in terms of accessories and skin attributes.
