# Projet 3A Shifumi IA

## Overview
This repository contains the Shifumi project developed by the LIS laboratory in collaboration with Centrale Méditerranée, focusing on the development of an artificial intelligence agent for the game of "Rock, Paper, Scissors" (Shifumi): the goal is to improve the gesture recognition capabilities to enhance the interaction between the AI agent and human players.

## Contents
- **Final Report**: The final report detailing the project's objectives, methodologies, results, and conclusions.
- **Gesture Recognition Folder**: Jupyter notebooks used for testing and development of the hand gesture recognition tool.
- **Integration Package**: A folder containing the overall project to be completed for integration.
- **Dataset**: A folder containing some data we used for the project.

## Project Description
The Shifumi project focuses on enhancing the hand gesture recognition system to be integrated into the larger project involving an artificial intelligence agent for the game of "Rock, Paper, Scissors" (Shifumi). The new gesture detection tool has been successfully developed and is fully functional. However, further work is needed to complete its integration into the main project.

## Collaboration
Charles Bouyrou and D. Rebecca HOUITTE worked on the development and testing of the hand gesture recognition tool.

Thank you for your interest in the Shifumi project!
