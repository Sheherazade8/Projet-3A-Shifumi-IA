# Projet3A_Shifumi_IA

## Overview
This repository contains the Shifumi project developed by the LIS laboratory in collaboration with Centrale Méditerranée, focusing on the development of an artificial intelligence agent for the game of "Rock, Paper, Scissors" (Shifumi): the goal is to improve the gesture recognition capabilities to enhance the interaction between the AI agent and human players.

## Contents
- **Final Report**: The final report detailing the project's objectives, methodologies, results, and conclusions.
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks used for testing and development of the hand gesture recognition tool.
- **Integration Package**: A folder containing the overall project to be completed for integration.

## Project Description
The Shifumi project focuses on enhancing the hand gesture recognition system to be integrated into the larger project involving an artificial intelligence agent for the game of "Rock, Paper, Scissors" (Shifumi). The improved gesture recognition system aims to enhance the interaction between the AI agent and human players by accurately recognizing hand gestures.

## Collaboration
Charles Bouyrou and D. rebecca HOUITTE worked on the development and testing of the hand gesture recognition tool.

## Repository Structure
- `/Final Report`: Contains the final report document.
- `/Notebooks`: Includes Jupyter notebooks used for testing and development.
- `/Integration Package`: Contains the project package for integration, including necessary files and code.

Thank you for your interest in the Shifumi project!
