# Gesture Recognition Folder

## Overview
This folder contains various notebooks and files related to gesture recognition for the Shifumi project. The notebooks include implementations of different methods for gesture classification, including Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and MediaPipe.

## Contents
- **cnn_model.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of a CNN classifier trained and tested for gesture recognition.
- **mediapipe_gesture_recognizer.ipynb**: Notebook implementing gesture recognition using the MediaPipe library.
- **knn_notebook.ipynb**: Notebook implementing gesture recognition using the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm with MediaPipe landmarks detection tool.
- **knn_from_csv.ipynb**: Notebook implementing gesture recognition using KNN with MediaPipe landmarks detection tool and landmarks.csv file.
- **references.docx**: File containing links to the references and resources used for the implementation of gesture recognition algorithms.
